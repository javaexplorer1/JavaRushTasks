# JavaRush Tasks
Here are collected tasks of varying complexity that I solved while studying the JavaRush course, including interesting mini-projects (tasks divided into several subtasks, as a result of the gradual solution of which relatively complex and large programs are created).

The advantage of the course is that the tasks help to immediately consolidate the acquired knowledge in practice. A clearly articulated list of requirements for each task and automatic verification of the correctness of the solution help to immediately analyze the  errors made  in the code and take actions to remove them.

The most interesting tasks:

[Chat](/3.JavaMultithreading/src/com/javarush/task/task30/task3008) - this is a program with which it will be possible to exchange text messages.

[MVC](/3.JavaMultithreading/src/com/javarush/task/task36/task3608) - this is a task for the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller) - an application that shows a list of users and does something with them, for example, updates their data and deletes them.
